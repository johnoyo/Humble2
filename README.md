    - **WebGPU**  support is planned for the future.
- Forward, API agnostic, PBR renderer that features shadow maps, equirectangular skyboxes and various post processing effects.

- Uses an ECS architecture using the [EnTT](https://github.com/skypjack/entt) library.
- Fully integrated C++ scripting support.
- Flexible job system with support for async asset loading.
- Powerfull physics support for 2D (using [Box2D](https://github.com/erincatto/box2d)) and 3D (using [Jolt](https://github.com/jrouwe/JoltPhysics)) games.
- Endless procedurally terrain support, utilizing the job system for multithreading.
- Support for prefabs (Instantiate, Unpack, Update, Destroy).
    - Nested prefabs support is planned for the future.
- Planned web support with [Emscripten](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk) using WebGPU to build games for the browser.
- Editor to Runtime workflow for publishing games properly without the editor.
- Currently supports only Windows.

Installation:
